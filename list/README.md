Implementation of the List ADT using an array
=============================================

This was an assignment for my Data Structures class. We were supposed to implement the List ADT using an array as the base data structure. I decided to use a circular array to improve performance when adding an element to the head of the list.

The code is in C++, written for Visual Studio 2010, but it also compiles with GCC. It uses C++ class templates for polymorphism; the list_expand.cpp file is where template parameters are specified. Included is an interactive test program (in main.cpp) that allows the user to exercise the functionality of the mylist class.

To compile, simply type make on the command line.
